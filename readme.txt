Frontend (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript):
1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Open index.html in a web browser (preferably using a local development server).

Node.js Backend:
1. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
2. Clone the GitHub repository (if not done already).
3. Navigate to the backend directory.
4. Install the required dependencies using npm install.
5. Start the Node.js backend server using node app.js.

Running the Application:
1. Ensure both frontend and backend are running.
2. Open your web browser and go to the frontend URL (e.g., http://localhost:8000/index.html).
3. Enter the required input values (Age, Height, and Weight) into the respective fields.
4. Click the "Calculate" button.
5. View the results in the modal dialog.

Remember to have both the frontend and backend running at the same time for the application to work correctly.

If any issues occur, check the browser console and the terminal where the backend is running for error messages to identify and troubleshoot any potential problems.
